## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Afolabi, and I have 8+ years of hands-on automation experience, designing, developing, maintaining, and enhancing automation frameworks. I helped establish sustainable QA automation processes adopted across multiple business units. This included framework setup, database configuration, test data generation, API test automation, automated script maintenance, and reporting dashboards for stakeholders.
